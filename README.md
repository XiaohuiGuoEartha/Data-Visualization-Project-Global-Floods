# Data-Visualization-Project-Global-Floods
This project showed you global floods happened from 1985 to 2015. Programming language used here is R. 

Please check the R file to check the code and please check the html page to check the data visualization.

The interactive 'Flood map' is coded using the R 'leaflet' package. Click each circle on the map you will see detail information of each flood from the year 1985 to 2015 globally. The color of the circle represents the flood magnitude. You could also choose the map style from the up right corner. There are three options: "Dark Map", "Basic Map" and "Satellite Map".

The Circlize_graph shows the relationship between month and magnitude. Put your mouse cursor on the graph you will see detail information.
